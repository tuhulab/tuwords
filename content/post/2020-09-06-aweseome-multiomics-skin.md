I'm maintaining a knowledge base [Awesome Multi-omics Skin](https://github.com/tuhulab/awesome-multiomics-skin). I collect and briefly summarize all latest dermatological studies, which use omics (including multi-omics) and bioinformatics techniques.

The scientific informatics department of my institute offers support for collecting the information source. I sincerely acknowledge their help.
