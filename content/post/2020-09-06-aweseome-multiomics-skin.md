I'm maintaining a knowledge base [Awesome Multi-omics Skin](https://github.com/tuhulab/awesome-multiomics-skin). I collect and briefly summarize the dermatological studies, which use omics or multi-omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome data.

This knowledge base gets technical support from my institute's scientific information department. I sincerely acknowledge their help.
