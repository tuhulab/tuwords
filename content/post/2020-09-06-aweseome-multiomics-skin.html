<p>Iâ€™m maintaining a knowledge base <a href="https://github.com/tuhulab/awesome-multiomics-skin">Awesome Multi-omics Skin</a>. I collect and briefly summarize all latest dermatological studies, which use omics (including multi-omics) and bioinformatics techniques.</p>
<p>The scientific informatics department of my institute offers support for collecting the information source. I sincerely acknowledge their help.</p>
